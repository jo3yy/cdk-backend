# Joey's CDK Fullstack playground

Here is just my learning playground with AWS CDK

I will eventually create a full serviceless project with Cognito and Amplify
Serverless API with API Gateway, Lambda's, Dynamo DB, S3 and CloudFront
Build a FE with React (TS)

This will be fully deployable via AWS CDK to S3 and CloudFront

## Resources created thus far.

- AWS CDK
- Lambda
- Node Lambda
- API Gateway
- Dynamo DB
